Do:
1. Initial set of commands:
    - root [done]
    - branch [done]
    - status [done]
    - .hgignore support [done]

Don't:
1. No i18n, only English to be supported.
2. No colored output.

Stages:
0. The dumbest proof-of-concept read-only hgo tool.
1. Repo and UI types, more read only commands. May be even web server, and VFS.
2. Add profiling for everything instead of --profile option (See https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Diagnostics, https://blog.golang.org/profiling-go-programs)
3. Plugins.
4. Everything related to write and update repo.


Notes:
Switch to https://github.com/hashicorp/go-immutable-radix once I'm ready to write operations.
